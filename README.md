## Project Details 
<p>In this project, the backend development follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, where the backend is separated into different parts. Each of these parts will be explained in detail here to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project's structural design and organization.</P>

### db -> Database Management
<p>"The models in this section encapsulate the essential structural components of each database table, providing a clear and organized representation of the data schema. Meanwhile, the database manager, following a singleton design pattern, plays a pivotal role in database interactions. It establishes and maintains connections to the database, ensures data is regularly refreshed, and employs caching mechanisms to optimize data retrieval and storage performance. By effectively managing the interplay between models and the database, this project establishes a robust foundation for data storage and retrieval within the MVC architecture."</p>


### users.py -> User Module :

<p>"The user module is responsible for defining user profiles with unique attributes, including usernames, emails, phone numbers, passwords, and user IDs. It enforces validation rules for each attribute, such as unique usernames and proper email formats. Additionally, it tracks user registration and login dates, ensuring accurate user activity logs."</p>


### main.py -> main Model :

<p>"The main module acts as the central hub of the application, orchestrating the flow of user interactions and coordinating the various components of the backend. It houses the core functionalities, including user authentication, cinema session management, and transaction processing. By leveraging a loop that continually awaits and processes user requests, the main module ensures seamless communication with multiple users simultaneously. Additionally, it employs an event-driven model to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently, allowing for real-time updates and responsiveness in user interactions."</p>



### client.py -> client Model:

<p>The client module simulates a user interacting with the system. Users can log in, perform various actions, and log out. The client module ensures concurrent user interactions without interference.</p>

### Usage

<p>To run the project, execute the following command:</p>

```bash
python main.py
```

<p>Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the application, perform actions, and experience the functionalities offered by CinemaManagement.</p>

### Report

<p>The CinemaSwift project successfully implements an online cinema reservation system with user authentication, film rating, and reservation functionalities. The MVC architecture ensures a well-organized and modular codebase, promoting code reusability and maintainability. The project's main execution module, users module, and client interaction module work in harmony to provide users with a smooth and efficient experience.

The installation guide facilitates the setup process, ensuring that users can quickly deploy the system on their local machines. By following the outlined steps, users can create a virtual environment, install necessary dependencies, and start exploring the functionalities of CinemaSwift.

Overall, the project showcases effective backend development practices, encapsulating database management, user models, and client interactions in a cohesive structure. The modular design allows for easy extension and modification, making it an excellent foundation for future enhancements and feature additions.</p>
